								<p>In 2024, I completed a four-month internship at DC Technology, a cybersecurity marketing company based in Dubai. My role involved helping other businesses strengthen their digital security by providing them with top-tier cybersecurity software. I contributed both on the technical and marketing fronts—installing secure servers in person for clients and reaching out to potential customers through calls and presentations. I actively promoted our software as the best alternative in the market, highlighting its reliability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. One of the most impactful aspects of my internship was our partnership with Sangfor, a globally recognized leader in cybersecurity and cloud solutions. This collaboration allowed us to offer cutting-edge technologies and build trust with clients who were looking for robust protection against cyber threats. Working at DC Technology gave me hands-on experience in client engagement, technical implementation, and strategic marketing, all within a fast-paced and innovative environment.</p>
								<p> Alongside my internship, I also participated in an AI program called Inspirit AI, which was taught by alumni from Harvard and MIT. This two-week intensive program focused on using artificial intelligence to detect exoplanets—planets outside our solar system—by training machine learning models to identify patterns in astronomical data. I worked in a team of five, and the experience was incredibly collaborative. We explored different AI models, compared their accuracy, and learned how to interpret complex datasets. The project not only deepened my understanding of AI applications in scientific research but also helped me develop essential soft skills. I took on leadership responsibilities within the group, coordinating tasks, facilitating discussions, and ensuring that our efforts were aligned. The collaborative nature of the program taught me how to communicate effectively, delegate responsibilities, and motivate a team toward a shared goal. It was a transformative experience that complemented my technical growth with strong interpersonal development.</p>
